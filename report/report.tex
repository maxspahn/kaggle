\section{Preparation of the data}
The accesible data for the "kaggle"-competition is raw. The different parameters
are not normilized and has to be modified in order to apply the \textsc{sklearn}
algorithmes on it. The first modification we did was a circular permutation in
order to "normalize" parameters of time, such as \textsc{month, daytime, etc}.
The problem about time values is, that computers do not reckognize that January
and December are "close" to one each other. We arranged those parameters around
a clock, with an x-coordinate and a y-coordinate, so that with these two new
variables january and december get "close".
